FNL Project

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, run the following command to install all the dependencies:

sh

Copy code

yarn install

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running:

sh

Copy code

yarn start

This will start the app in development mode and open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

yarn build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

yarn test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about running tests for more information.

yarn eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

Other Scripts

You can also run the following scripts:

yarn lint

Runs the linter to check for any lint errors.
